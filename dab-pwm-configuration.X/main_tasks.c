// @file main_tasks.c
//
// @brief contains the application specific tasks that are called regularly by the os_scheduler
//        two different timings priorities are available:
//          1. 1ms Tasks called from the os_scheduler interrupt
//              the jitter that you will have in the 1ms realtime tasks called by the interrupt depends
//              on other interrupts that have a higher interrupt priority
//          2. 1ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1s Tasks called from the main loop
//              these tasks are for soft realtime and not for hard realtime
//              so in average they are called with the required timing but the jitter can be very huge,
//              depending on the calls before.
//              use this for your non-timing critical application state machines
//
// @note    you might consider to implement a watchdog and put the watchdog triggering into some Task
//

//
//  Interrupt Realtime Functions:
//  Tasks_Realtime_1ms  :   is called by the interrupt every ms - for time critical low jitter stuff
//
//
//  Mainloop Non-Realtime Functions:
//  Tasks_1ms           :   function is called by the main loop in average every 1ms
//  Tasks_10ms          :   function is called by the main loop in average every 10ms
//  Tasks_100ms         :   function is called by the main loop in average every 100ms
//  Tasks_1s            :   function is called by the main loop in average every second
//
//  @note there could be some jitter here because it is not called directly by a timer interrupt
//        the timing in average is exact (keep in mind: in average), the jitter depends on the
//        called functions before
